# Exploring LSTM for Bitcoin Price Prediction
This research focuses on analyzing the relationship
between Bitcoin prices, trading rates and volume to predict
prices in 15-minute candle intervals. The study proposes the
use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for
developing a reliable prediction model. Historical Bitcoin data
was obtained from the Binance API and underwent collection
and preprocessing. The performance of the prediction model is
evaluated against the real one. The findings contribute to the
analysis of cryptocurrency markets, enabling investors to make
informed real-time decisions, facilitating the development of
advanced trading algorithms and risk management strategies in
the cryptocurrency space.
